Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: An example of a field data science can be applied to is the healthcare field. In this field data science can help to predict and model health data and statistics such as
taking previous disease health data from the past, performing analysis and going through the data science methodology/life-cycle, and then developing a model such as a
machine learning model of the data. This model can be developed in a way to predict the likelihood of a disease spreading to certain regions based on the training data which can
overall help in making informed policy decisions for stakeholders such as government health offices among others.
